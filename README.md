# UCD COMP41720 | Quoco Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the [COMP41720](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&MODULE=COMP41720) module held by Rem Collier at the University College Dublin. The assignments all follow the same basic scheme but are implemented using different distributed techniques. For each version/assignment, [there is a branch](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/ucd-COMP41720/branches).

## Adding new branches from local repositories

Each branch is a separate commit history, committed from a locally initialized repository. If you want to commit the same crimes as I did (pun intended) or if I forget, here are the relevant commands:

```bash
git remote add shared git@github.com:TilBlechschmidt/ucd-COMP41720.git
git checkout -b <name>
git push -u shared <name>
# Profit!
```
