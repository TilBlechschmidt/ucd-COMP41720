# UCD COMP41720 | Quoco Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the [COMP41720](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&MODULE=COMP41720) module held by Rem Collier at the University College Dublin. The assignments all follow the same basic scheme but are implemented using different distributed techniques. For each version/assignment, [there is a branch](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/ucd-COMP41720/branches).
